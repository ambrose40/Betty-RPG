 TIME ELEMENTS - CHARACTER SPRITE ASSETS
 PATREON PRE-RELEASE
-==-=- -==-=- -==-=- -==-=- -==-=-

Thank you for downloading this collection. This is a PRE-RELEASE ASSET exclusive for PATRONS.

The content included in this pack is planned to be the content for the 
initial "Time Elements" character release.

In addition to the sprite pieces contained in this pack, the final 
product will include some finished pre-made sprites, and a detailed PDF 
with instructions and tips (didn't have time to make these additions 
before this release).

Let me know if there's any problems or bugs with the assets.

(I also have a bunch of designs for more pieces that I'll make for 
future expansions. And of course, I'll be eager for patron suggestions 
once we get rolling with those!)

------------
Note on ASSET LAYERING:

There are a lot of moving parts (literally), and it makes the layering 
complex. For example, any animation that moves  arms in front of or 
behind the head creates inconsistencies. Some poses are impossible to 
cover every case with automatic layers.

Therefore:

If you are planning on using these pieces in a game engine of your own, 
note that there will be complexities and edge cases: layers will need 
to order themselves differently depending on the animation.

If you're planning on using these pieces to assemble full characters 
using something like Photoshop, then it will be easier for you to modify 
and edit individual problems as necessary.


------------
Note on SKIN COLOR PALETTE:

Right now, the default assets only use a single skin-tone. The reason for 
this is because the skin-tone palette is the the only color palette that 
is consistent across all layers (for example, the "top" layer has hands, 
etc). This palette has its own unique  colors consistent across those 
layers, making it easy for users to color the entire character at once.

Therefore, the skin color palette would best be updated for the sprite as 
a whole, instead of for each individual layer.

For artists assembling characters from the pieces, coloring the entire 
finished spritesheet at once should be fairly simple. For programmers who 
will be using these pieces to create in-game character generators, the best 
option might be a shader that can color the entire sprite.

In the final version of this asset pack, I'll design additional skin-tone 
color palettes and provide the color values in the PDF.


------------
Notes for the included CHARACTER GENERATOR:

This is a little program that a friend put together. This is included with
the pack as a bonus. It's designed specifically to work with the Time Elements 
assets. It can export regular sheets as well as sheets formatted for RPGMaker.

You can add more assets just by putting more PNG files into the folders. If you 
make additional color variations to the existing pieces, or make your own new 
pieces, just add them to the folder and follow the naming conventions of the 
assets I've already put there. Your new files should work in the generator.

The generator isn't 100% complete-- there are still some little things that we 
need to clean up -- if you find other bugs or issues, please let me know.

ALSO: I've included a .png that explains the layout of the RPGMaker export.


Thanks, fbb
