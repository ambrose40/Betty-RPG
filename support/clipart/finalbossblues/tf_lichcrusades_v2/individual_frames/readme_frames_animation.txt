When working with the individual frames:

The frames are named like such:

down_stand
down_walk1
down_walk2
left_stand
left_walk1
left_walk2
etc...

To animate them properly, use the "stand" frame after each alternating "walk" frame. For example:

stand, walk1, stand, walk2, stand, walk1, stand ... etc

That will create the intended walking animation.

Of course, the "stand" frame is also used for the idle frame when not animated.

Thanks!
