# Xsize:??? and Ysize:??? define the size of the generated image.
#
# The rest defines how the parts in each folder
# are ordered on each other; that is, their "height."
# Note that when "HeadA.png" is loaded, "HeadA$.png" is auto-loaded as well and added in the back.
#
# Example:
#  If "Head=2 Upper Body=1 Lower Body=0",
#  it is drawn in the order "Head > Upper Body > Lower Body > Lower Body (with $) > Upper Body (with $) > Head (with %)."
#  Put the names of each folder before the "=" signs.
#
# If you put a "#" at the start of a line, it is treated as a comment.

# As of the 5/11/2010 version, by entering [,F] or [,B] after the number in Folder Settings,
# such as "Head=3,F", you can make hue changes only affect Front images [those without a $]
# or Back images [those with a $]. (* Saturation applies to both front and back.)
